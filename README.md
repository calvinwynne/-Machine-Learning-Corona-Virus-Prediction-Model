# -Machine-Learning-Corona-Virus-Prediction-Model

A Machine learning Model that Predicts the number of affected, recovered and dead cases for the next 5 days
This model works based on data pulled from https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ website.

This project runs a regression over the time series data collected from the above website.

The project is broken down into multiple scipts that performs different tasks to make understanding the script, much easier.

The end result would be a prediction for Affected, Recovererd and Deaths for the next 5 days.
If needed, using the Plotter.py script plots the time series historic data along with the predictions.
